TODO: outline.

Karp's paper:
Competitive ratio of cardinality is best for :
refer to ......
online unweighted matching for
1/2 for greedy
any deterministic algo: worst case competitive ratio of 1/2

any
randomly fix the priority of the workers and assign based on priority
(contrasted with randomly picking a viable worker to assign)
can try random priority

can mention maximum matching as a variant we are studying
can look at offline/online weighted(considers distance) and unweighted for categories (1 or 2 per case)
offline unweighted: shareability
online (un)weighted: greedy, hst, online bipartite ranking (karp), batch (nature)
offline weighted: maximum flow

look at comparisons, results,

can analyse actual efficiency (not asymptotic)

dont care about weights

task assignment looks at cost, whereas online bipartite matching looks at cardinality
edges: workers that can make it in time

framing ota with max delay constraint as maximum matching: must have maximum cardinality
successful served trips
