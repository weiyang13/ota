Closed issues:
    Slide updates (#31 and #40):
        A legend would be useful for the presentation slides to make it self contained

        Average and maximum waiting time found to be non-monotonic
            still required to optimise subject to maximum waiting time
            penalty function may be complicated to optimise, can look at percentage fulfilled instead

        experiment was done in a unit square with unit velocity

Open issues:
    Nature paper:
        uses shareability graph
        motivation is also to decrease manpower, but not directly applicable

        shareability graph may not work for our problem
            delay for two requests are cumulative: delay for first request carries on to second request
            lower bound is not that important or easy to get

Future work:
    Can eliminate randomness by fixing agents' initial position to e.g. (0.5, 0.5)

    Repeat experiment with same parameter except seed, and get average values

    Current algorithm not designed to minimise maximum delay
        One approach: Given a maximum delay, choose from set of workers that meet constraint
            Identify heuristics for this choice

    Perform experiment on real data (NYC)
