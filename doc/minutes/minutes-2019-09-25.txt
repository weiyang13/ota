Nature paper:
    Offline algorithm
            Offline algorithm is very different from batch based online algorithm
            Offline algorithm used as a baseline for comparison
            Not directly applicable to solving the problem
            Can mention this in lit review
    Not clear: are trips that are not successfully served served at all
        ACTION: Send email soon to ask for code.

Lit review
    Diagrams: could do static animations, like Tong et al (2016)
        Could also borrow diagrams from other papers, citing source
    Guidelines available, expected 6-10 pages
    After reviewing papers, identify gaps in research

Future work
    Can consider trying batch in the future.

    Use of shareability graph for our case can give an upper bound on minimum fleet size
        difficult to solve for optimal using shareability
        can assume maximum delay for all tasks as an approximation
        should still focus on online case


    Greedy forces you to choose minimum waiting time, but there is a set of feasible workers
        Can look at G-llep (Least Location Entropy Priority)
            refer to Kazami et al. (reference from cheng et al),
        batch based, need to check if this is implemented in online in the original paper
