Open issues
    #30 (refactoring):
        Too big of an issue
        ACTION: Rename, and separate into multiple issues
        data format
            DataFrame cannot be nested - cannot represent composition of agent nicely
            Go for more flexible structure at the beginning


    #30 (analysis):
        Can use similar as last time, but with corrected code and max waiting time instead
        Don't overengineer the prototype right now, do minimum required to get analysis out
        compare the modified and pre-modified greedy
            assign to the next agent that is idle
            interesting pre-observations: minimize idle time / maximise utilisation
        ACTION: continue with analysis, delay refactoring

    Milestones
        Use milestones to organize issues

    #36 (Nature paper):
		Website: http://senseable.mit.edu/MinimumFleet/
        Good place to start the literature review
        Page 8: can email to ask for code
            ACTION: draft email.
        In the paper, it uses a shareability graph, constrained to a maximum idle time for each taxi
            Minimum (acyclic) path cover used : polynomial time, equivalent to maximum matching
            exact minimum number of taxis/paths given for total information
            batch method discussed as well (batch model) vs on-the-fly model
            can refer for exact lower bound given full information

    Lit review organisation:
        Nomenclature
            No definitive answer, doesn't really matter

        Format (final):
            Use Overleaf, and export tex files

        For each paper: summarize impt points from that paper.
            Main ideas: e.g. shareability graph in #36
            Filter out irrelevant parts: e.g. multi-agent problems
        Then group papers together to better organise lit review.
        Can split into offline / online (batch / on-the-fly)

        Create issues to read the paper and find impt points (1 issue for each)
            Start with #36

        Other taxi papers
            Of similar content to nature paper, but poorer quality
            Just look at nature paper for offline

        Older papers for online
            Tong et al (2016), Nature paper
            multiple duplicate papers

        ACTION: Read Nature paper, then Tong et al, as well as relevant references
            separate issues for each paper
            write main ideas of the paper

        ACTION: Write out problem for lit review

    #14
        Not so relevant right now

    Model of agents
        Currently it is randomly generated
        For fleet, may be better to spawn at depos, rather than depo
        Can justify random
        For much later: proactively move to agents to a waiting area
            find unreachable parts of the unit square given
            a cover problem: find ways to maximise cover of requests with current fleet
