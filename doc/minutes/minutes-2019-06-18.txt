Present:
  Hon Wai
  Melvin
  Wei Yang
  De Hui

Wei Yang gave a presentation of rough project plan:
  The general problem is real time delivery fleet optimization
  Looking at VRP problems as they are on graph, see if they can be done online

  Sources of risk
    lack of project data

    don't have coordinates for locations only names 

    not familiar with Python

Advise from Hon Wai
  start with OTA and greedy algorithm
  try using existing dataset published by other research groups
  refer to sample project plan to prepare for presentation next week

Comments from Melvin
  need the data to estimate the travel time between locations

  we can start with (x,y) first for simplicity, should not affect the problem
  formulation/algorithms
