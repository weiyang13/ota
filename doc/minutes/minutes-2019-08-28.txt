Meetings with Prof Leong are now scheduled on Mondays, 4-6pm.

Prototype - I have made a quick prototype of the greedy algorithm on a
Cartesian plane, and did a quick analysis based on the prototype (I have
pushed the relevant files)

(a) For this prototype, I am coding in Java first. I will switch to Python in
future prototypes but I'm more comfortable with Java right now

(b) There is a major bug affecting the results which I have not yet debugged.

(c) In addition to debugging, Prof has asked me to write a verifier for the
algorithm.
